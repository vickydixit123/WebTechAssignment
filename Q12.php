// Q12.
// Scenario: You are building a subscription-based 
// service where users can choose between different 
// subscription plans. However,    
// you want to offer a trial period for new users. Write a  
// PHP script    
// that checks if the user is a new user and offers them a trial 
// period if they haven't subscribed before.    
// Edit    
// Tools    
// Selection

$userIsNew = true;

if ($userIsNew) {
    echo "You qualify for a trial period";
} else {
    echo "Thank you for intrest in our service";
}
